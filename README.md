# Interact_with_D-Tube
This is an extra credit exercise in MI4 of Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program

**Exercise: Interact with DTube** (Optional)

DTube is the first crypto-decentralized video platform, built on top of the STEEM Blockchain and the IPFS peer-to-
peer network.

According to DTube, the platform aims to become an alternative to YouTube that allows you to watch or upload
videos on IPFS and share or comment about it on the immutable STEEM Blockchain, while earning cryptocurrency
doing it. Because of the decentralized nature of IPFS and the STEEM blockchain, DTube is not able to censor videos,
nor enforce guidelines. Only the users can censor it, through the power of their upvotes and downvotes. On DTube,
there are no hidden algorithms controlling the visibility or monetization of certain videos over others. All of DTube's
data is public and can be analyzed by anyone with an internet connection.
DTube is powered by the Steem Blockchain and IPFS.

It is important to note that DTube is currently on Testnet Mode, therefore, the tokens have no value until the

platform launches on the MainNet, scheduled on 10th of May 2020 *(https://steemit.com/dtube/@dtube/dtube-
